well since we are talking about norms it reminds me of RIP Norm macdonalled, one of my favorite comedians
so any way what is mathimatical norm and especially $L_p$ norm and $L^2$ space and unit sphere and all this?

so norms are something that assing postive value to a vector that gonna show its magnitiude somehow, and is associaed with $L_P$ norm mostly and the reason they call it L comes from Labesge norm inwhich Labesge was a mathmatician in early 20th centery mostly known for his Phd thesis on Labesge integrals (not a very usefull thing, but mostly solve problems with riemann integral in encountring crazy functions like Dirichlet function and subjects like measure theory, like how countability and uncountablity effects integral like cantor's paradox and hilbert hotel problem)
