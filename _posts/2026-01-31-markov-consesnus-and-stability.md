# Introduction

so markov is like for probaiblty and consesnus is working with big numbers, why all converge ? because it is stable autonmous system , irriducible(strongly connected:reach from anywhere to anywhere, notet that graph is directed) in Frobenius words nad also ergodic(aperiodic) , in math it can be formulated into Perron-Frobenius (PF) Theorem where pf eigen vector there is the one who decide .
